# UWP
This UWP is for Mobile Applications Development

It is titled Jumpy Joe.
## Description
The aim of this project was to develop an application for the Universal Windows Platform. I chose to use Unity to make a game.

## Design
The game consists of a main menu and 3 levels. The game is called Jumpy Joe and was inspired by games such as Super Mario Bros.
The player can run and jump, and collect coins to gain score which is then saved to local storage.
There are enemies which the player can jump on to kill. There are also moving platforms.
All of the assets I used were completely free and the audio I took from the public domain.
I enjoyed learning how to use Unity game engine and feel like I have come a long way in terms of game development. 

## How to run
The game can be run by opening UWP.sln in visual studio which resides in the Build folder.
Simply build and run.
I have also included the Unity build which is also in the Build folder
